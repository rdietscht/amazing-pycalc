# Amazing PyCalc (Git TA Tip)

This amazingly simple Python module can be imported into your project to perform simple (but tedious) math computations! All you need to do is call a function, and you can get the results for **1 of 7** different typical math operations (listed below) based on __user input__.

## Currently supported operations:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exponentiation
6. Average
7. Hypotenuse

**_Note: Some early beta testers have reported faulty code with some of the modules. If you encounter any bugs, we invite any brave open-source contributers to push their changes to this repository._**
